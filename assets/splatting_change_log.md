# Splatting GUI Changelog
All notable changes to the splatting GUI and related components.
## [Unreleased]
### Added
- **Manual Mode for Auto-Convergence:** New "Manual" mode writes current slider values to sidecars during AUTO-PASS without calculating auto-convergence.
- **MinBorders Auto-Convergence Mode:** New mode available in GUI/preview/AUTO-PASS and batch processing, using depth-only border-void minimization.
- **Runner Sidecar Safety Policy:** `batch_splatting_runner.py` can now warn/prompt/delete existing sidecars before processing.
- **Runner CSV Convergence Overrides:** Optional CSV import for per-clip convergence values (fill-missing or override-all policy).
- **Sidecar Migration Menu Items:** Two new File menu options to move sidecars between folders:
  - "Sidecars: Depth → Source (remove _depth)" - moves sidecars from depth folder to source folder
  - "Sidecars: Source → Depth (add _depth)" - moves sidecars from source folder to depth folder
### Changed
- **Auto-Convergence "Off" Behavior:** AUTO-PASS no longer overwrites sidecar values when set to "Off" - existing sidecar values are now preserved.
- **AUTO-PASS Border Mode:** When GUI Border Mode is "Auto Basic" or "Auto Adv.", AUTO-PASS now stores values in `auto_border_L`/`auto_border_R` fields (for UI caching) and keeps `border_mode` as "Auto Basic"/"Auto Adv." instead of switching to "Manual".
### Fixed
- **Auto-Convergence Cache Clearing:** Fixed clip navigation not clearing cached Average/Peak values, which caused incorrect values to be applied when switching between clips.

## [Released] - 2026-02-04
### Refactored
- **Code Consolidation**: Removed duplicate depth processing code from `splatting_gui.py` (lines 7018-7234)
  - `compute_global_depth_stats()` function now imported from `core.splatting.depth_processing`
  - `load_pre_rendered_depth()` function now imported from `core.splatting.depth_processing`
  - Removed local redefinitions of `_NumpyBatch` and `_ResizingDepthReader` classes
  - Eliminated ~216 lines of duplicated code
### Changed
- **Slider Behavior Enhancement** (`dependency/stereocrafter_util.py`):
  - **Middle-click**: Slider now jumps directly to mouse pointer position (matches frame scrubber behavior)
  - **Right-click**: Resets slider to default value
  - **Left-click**: Maintains original stepped increment behavior
- **Browes Folder Buttons:** Right-Click opens explorer window at paths location.
- **Combined Scanning:** `Auto Convergence` and `Boarder Depth` into a single pass.
### Fixed
- Slider middle-click functionality now provides precise positioning like the frame scrubber
